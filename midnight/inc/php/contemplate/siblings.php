            <p>After watching the last episode of the anime <i>Koi Kaze (恋風, lit. "Love Wind")</i>, some thoughts about the right to love whoever you want filled my mind. I wonder if it feels like a curse to be born as the sibling to the person you love. I mean think about it, how would you feel if you knew you were a <b>"freak"</b> for being in love. You don't choose your parents and you don't choose who you fall in love with.</p>

            <p>As well as I can't imagine the fear the person must feel when declaring their love for the first time and knowing they will almost certainly be rejected. Even if they manage to pass the big hurdle of acknowledging their love for each other, they have to be secret about it. That's another point I flinch about, when you're in love you want the world to know that you are happy together.</p>

            <p>Even though I wouldn't think about entering a relationship with my sibling, I know that there are more than a handful of different people in the world. I would want to love my other half freely, and legally so why wouldn't they. I'm still thinking about my opinion on the matter.</p>
