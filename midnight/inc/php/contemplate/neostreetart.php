            <p>Art should make you think while exploring new ways to materialize or idealize creativity. At least that's an idea about art, which now coincidences perfectly with my imagination. Wouldn't street art made of glass be really beautiful? Especially if you take the sun shining through it in too consideration.</p>

            <p>However the perfection of the art form lies in it's collaboration with the artist and the whole city. Since glass arts fragility is it's weakness, the citizens take an active role in determine the fate of the art, therefore creating a connection with the art to the humanity. Like the nature and the humanity, which we constantly ravage. Destruction of the art shows this side of humans; abduction of the art shows the censure of the government and the survival of the art is beautiful symbiosis. Therefore shortening the distance with art and actions.</p>

            <p>The downsides of this project is environmental endangerment caused by the potential glass shards, the cost of constructing a glass art sculpture and the difficulty to remain anonymous after placing the sculpture since glass blowing is a rare skill it can easily be traced.</p>

            <p>Despite all the ups and downs, I'd like to see this art form while examining it with hundreds of other curious citizens.</p>
